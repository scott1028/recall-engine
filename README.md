# recall-engine

`recall-engine` is a thin launcher that wraps an agent CLI (`claude`,
`codex`, `pi`, `gemini`, `opencode`, or `agy`) with a git-based Markdown
knowledge base. It
prepares a knowledge repo (local path or SSH clone), links `<repo>/src` into
the current project as `.knowledge` (so sandboxed agents can reach an
out-of-project repo), injects a skill that makes the agent consult
`.knowledge/*.md` — its record of past processing and notes — before replying
to any message, launches the agent, and restores everything on exit. It also
ships a one-way sync between a Google Drive folder and the repo's `src/`
directory.

## Install

From a checkout of this repository:

```bash
uv tool install .
# or
pipx install .
```

Requirements: Python >= 3.10, `git`, and at least one supported agent CLI:
Claude Code (https://claude.com/claude-code), Codex CLI
(https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli), pi
(https://github.com/earendil-works/pi), Gemini CLI
(https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), opencode, or agy. The install
provides the `recall-engine` entry point.

## Quickstart

```bash
# local knowledge repo
KNOWLEDGE_REPO_PATH=~/workspace/recall recall-engine wrap claude

# clone via SSH (default dest ./.recall)
KNOWLEDGE_REPO_SSH="git@github.com:developer/recall.git" recall-engine wrap claude

# explicit ssh key
KNOWLEDGE_REPO_SSH="git@github.com:developer/recall.git" SSH_KEY=~/.ssh/id_rsa recall-engine wrap claude

# other agent CLIs
KNOWLEDGE_REPO_PATH=~/workspace/recall recall-engine wrap codex
KNOWLEDGE_REPO_PATH=~/workspace/recall recall-engine wrap pi
KNOWLEDGE_REPO_PATH=~/workspace/recall recall-engine wrap gemini
KNOWLEDGE_REPO_PATH=~/workspace/recall recall-engine wrap opencode
KNOWLEDGE_REPO_PATH=~/workspace/recall recall-engine wrap agy
```

## How wrap works

`recall-engine wrap <agent> [args...]` runs a five-step lifecycle.
Anything after `<agent>` is forwarded verbatim to the agent, and leading
environment variables are inherited, so
`AA=1 recall-engine wrap claude foo --bar` behaves like
`AA=1 claude foo --bar`:

1. **Prepare the repo** — `KNOWLEDGE_REPO_PATH` is used as-is;
   `KNOWLEDGE_REPO_SSH` clones to `./.recall` on first run and
   `git pull --ff-only` afterwards (a failed pull warns and keeps the existing
   checkout, so wrapping still works offline). The clone dir is added to the
   host project's `.git/info/exclude`.
2. **Inject the skill** — a rendered `SKILL.md` is written to
   `.agents/skills/recall-engine/` (the Agent Skills SSOT) in the
   current project, and `.claude/skills/`, `.gemini/skills/`, `.pi/skills/`,
   and `.opencode/skills/` get relative symlinks pointing at it, so every
   supported agent discovers the same skill (`codex` and `agy` read the SSOT
   directly, so they need no symlink). The repo's `src/` is also linked into
   the project as `.knowledge`, so the skill can search the knowledge base
   through an in-project path even when the repo lives outside the project
   (which sandboxed agents would otherwise block). Any pre-existing skill entry
   or `.knowledge` entry is backed up first, and a marker file tracks the
   session owners: multiple wrap sessions
   in the same directory attach to one injection (the marker records every
   owner pid), and the last session to exit restores the original state.
3. **Launch the agent** — as a child process with signals forwarded and
   `RECALL_REPO_PATH` set to the resolved repo path. Unknown command
   names (e.g. `claude-company`) are classified via their `--version` output
   or name tokens before launching.
4. **You work** — before replying to any message, the skill directs the agent
   to search and cite `.knowledge/*.md` and factor prior processing records and
   notes into the answer as past experience.
5. **Restore on exit** — normal exit or Ctrl+C removes the injected skill,
   symlinks, and the `.knowledge` link and restores any backups, then the
   wrapper returns the agent's exit code.

You can run several wrap sessions concurrently in the same project directory:
the first sets up the injected skill and each later one attaches to it, so the
skill stays in place until the last session exits. A later session may omit
`KNOWLEDGE_REPO_PATH` / `KNOWLEDGE_REPO_SSH` entirely — when neither is set, the
repo is auto-detected from the running session's marker (env vars still win when
set). Sessions started from different project directories are fully independent
— the marker, lock, and injected skill are all per-directory, so they never
block or attach to each other.

If the wrapper is killed hard (`kill -9`), the leftover state is detected and
repaired on the next `wrap`, or clean it manually with `recall-engine unwrap`.

Skill trigger reliability is higher on sonnet-tier models than on haiku
(empirical observation from real-session testing).

## Google Drive sync

### Setup

Drive access uses gcloud credentials with the Drive scope. Either login works:

```bash
# Option A: gcloud user login (token minted via `gcloud auth print-access-token`)
gcloud auth login --enable-gdrive-access

# Option B: Application Default Credentials (the default
# `gcloud auth application-default login` does NOT include the Drive scope)
gcloud auth application-default login \
  --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
```

ADC is tried first, then the user login. Some organizations also require a
quota project for ADC:
`gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project <project-id>`.

### Usage

```bash
KNOWLEDGE_DRIVE_FOLDER=Shared KNOWLEDGE_REPO_PATH=~/workspace/recall \
  recall-engine sync download   # Drive folder -> <repo>/src/

KNOWLEDGE_DRIVE_FOLDER=Shared KNOWLEDGE_REPO_PATH=~/workspace/recall \
  recall-engine sync upload     # <repo>/src/ -> Drive folder
```

`KNOWLEDGE_DRIVE_FOLDER` accepts either the Drive folder ID or the folder name.
Name matching is case-insensitive; if several folders share the name, sync
aborts and asks for the folder ID.

### Behavior notes

- Sync is **strictly one-way** per invocation; there is no merge.
- Files are **overwritten by name** (last writer wins) — the knowledge repo is
  a git repo, so `git diff` / `git checkout` are your safety net after a
  download.
- **Deletes never propagate**: removing a file on one side does not remove it
  on the other.
- Native Google Docs are **exported to `.md`** on download (verify the exported
  content quality yourself — tables, images, and formatting depend on Google's
  exporter).
- Upload never converts `.md` files back to native Google Docs; they stay
  plain Markdown files on Drive.
- Sync is **non-recursive**: only `<repo>/src/*.md` and the top level of the
  Drive folder are considered.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `KNOWLEDGE_REPO_PATH` | Path to an existing local knowledge repo (mutually exclusive with `KNOWLEDGE_REPO_SSH`; optional for a second `wrap` in a directory that already has a running session — the repo is auto-detected) |
| `KNOWLEDGE_REPO_SSH` | SSH URL of the knowledge repo; cloned to `./.recall` |
| `SSH_KEY` | SSH private key for clone/pull; defaults to auto-detection (`id_ed25519` → `id_ecdsa` → `id_rsa` in `~/.ssh`) |
| `KNOWLEDGE_DRIVE_FOLDER` | Google Drive folder ID or name (case-insensitive) for `sync download` / `sync upload` |

## Doctor

```bash
recall-engine doctor
```

Checks git, the supported agent CLIs on PATH (at least one of
claude/codex/pi/gemini/opencode/agy must be present; missing ones print
`[skip]`), ssh key,
repo configuration, and gcloud Drive access, printing `[ok]` / `[fail]` per
check with a fix instruction for each failure. Exits non-zero if any required
check fails.

## Manual E2E checklist

### wrap

1. In a scratch project, run `KNOWLEDGE_REPO_PATH=<sample-repo> recall-engine wrap <agent>`
   (repeat for each installed agent: claude, codex, pi, gemini, opencode, agy).
2. Send a message covered by a file in `<sample-repo>/src/`; observe the
   agent searches/reads the file and cites its `src/*.md` path.
3. Send an ordinary message not tied to any note; observe the agent still
   searches `src/*.md` first and, finding nothing, says so before answering
   from general knowledge. A bare greeting (e.g. "hi") may skip the search.
4. Quit the agent; verify `.agents/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`,
   `.gemini/skills/`, `.pi/skills/`, and `.opencode/skills/` contain no
   `recall-engine` leftovers, and that the `.knowledge` link is gone.

### drive sync

1. Create a Drive folder with a few `.md` files and a native Google Doc; note its folder ID.
2. Run `sync download`; verify the files landed in `<repo>/src/` and check the exported Doc's `.md` content.
3. Edit a local `.md`, run `sync upload`, and verify the change on Drive.

## Development
